<br>Environment Details:</br>
<br>IDE: Eclipse</br>
<br>Java Version: 17</br>
<br>Run as Java Application</br>
<p>Note: Please import the project as :

Import > General > Project from Folder</p>
<br>The Class Diagram for this project is given below</br>
<br><img>Capstone_UML.png</img></br>

<p><br>When the application is started, it will ask for the below simple admin and user inputs. Please enter according to the input prompt</br>
<br>1)Enter Admin Name:</br>
<br>2)Enter Admin ID (eg.001):</br>
<br>3)Enter Area Name (eg.Dortmund):</br>
<br>4)Enter Zipcode:</br>
<br>5)Enter Weather (eg. Sunny, Windy, etc.):</br>
<br>6)Enter Energy Source ID (eg. ES001):</br>
<br>7)Enter Energy Source Name (eg.Solar, Hydro, Wind):</br>
<br>8)Enter Energy Capacity (eg.1000w):</br>
<br>9)Do you want to add more energy sources? (yes/no):(Continue if you want to add more energy sources)</br> 
<br>10)Do you want to add more locations? (yes/no): (Continue if you want to add more locations)</br>
<br>11)Enter Car Owner Name</br>
<br>12)Enter Car Number</br>
<br>13)Enter Slot Book Date & Time (dd-mm-yyyy HH:mm (24 hours)):</br>
<br>14)Enter Battery Level % (eg.10):</br>
<br>15)Enter Car Brand</br>
<br>16)Do you want to add more users? (yes/no):(Continue if you want to add more cars</br>
<br>If user inputs no, then the program books allocated the slots to the cars as per the algorithm based on the requirement.</br>
</p>
<p><br>The application calculates the waiting time for the cars. The waiting time is logged in the file CalcWaitTimeForCars.log file.</br>
<br>Similarly the cars getting a slot and entering the queue is being logged in the file PriorityQueueLogs.log</br>
<br>User input is being captured in UserData.log log file</br>
<br>Admin data and admin activity are being captured in AdminData.log and AdminActivity.log files respectively</br>
<br>Logs for charging of alternate batteries are being captured in ChargeReservedBatteries.log </br>
<br>All metadata of the logs file are being logged in Metadata.log file </br>
<br>Error occured in main method are being logged in ChargeStationMainLogs.txt</br>
<br>Error in charge station file are logged in ChargeStation.log file</br>
<br>Logs related to EnergySource are logged in EnergySource.log file</br>
<br>Log file related activity is being logged in ManageFile.txt</br></p>

<br>Please add JUnit 5 libraries in project build path to run JUnits</br>

<br>Description: In this task, have added junits for the classes already created.</br>
